[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/redhat-cop/pathfinder.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/redhat-cop/pathfinder) [![Docker Repository on Quay](https://quay.io/repository/pathfinder/pathfinder-server/status "Docker Repository on Quay")](https://quay.io/repository/pathfinder/pathfinder-server)


# Setup environment on OpenShift (incl. minishift)

The following commands will create a new project and deploy a mongo, pathfinder-server and pathfinder-ui instance into your environment
```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/redhat-cop/pathfinder/master/pathfinder-full-template.yaml

oc new-project <your-new-project-name>
oc new-app --template=mongodb-persistent --param=MONGODB_DATABASE=pathfinder
oc process -f pathfinder-full-template.yaml|oc create -f-
```

Note: If the mongodb template can't be found, you can restore it after creating your new project and before creating the mongodb instance:
```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift/origin/master/examples/db-templates/mongodb-persistent-template.json
oc create -f mongodb-persistent-template.json
```

Login as admin/admin and start adding customers and apps. Once added assess the apps, review and decide what to do and then hit generate report to see the collective outcome and recommendations.

## Using custom questions

Assuming the mongo db is present.

Create a config map with questions customization with the following command.
```
oc create configmap pathfinder-custom-files \
  --from-file=customQuestions.json=pathfinder-server/src/main/resources/questions/custom-questions-example.json
```

Create a pathfinder-server and pathfinder-ui with custom questions using this command:

```
oc process --param=VERSION=master -f pathfinder-full-custom-questions-template.yaml | oc create -f-
```

NOTE: `master` version is required, until `release` will include this feature.


# Usage Tracking
Pathfinder uses analytics to track usage of the application. This can be turned off by setting the "-DdisableTracking=true" JVM option on the Pathfinder UI application.
See the file "run-local.sh" under the pathfinder-ui directory for an example of how to do this.
